# CAA Scheduler

CAA Scheduler is the migration target for Coastal American Airways schedule construction. It moves the durable schedule state and deterministic processing out of an LLM conversation and into version-controlled code and data.

## Milestone 0.7 — planning foundation

The migration baseline now proves this pipeline:

```text
v2.2.5 workbook + pinned city data
    -> canonical schedule JSON
    -> validation report
    -> timetable JSON
    -> exact comparison with the published v2.2.5 timetable data
    -> gate assignment JSON
    -> exact comparison with the published v2.2.5 gate data
    -> operating-rule validation with evidence and explicit overrides
    -> build-instruction catalog generated from editable Markdown
    -> GitHub Pages operating console
    -> schedule-specific setup + deterministic preflight
    -> portable build_config.json
    -> Python candidate compiler + repeated preflight
    -> structural and operating reports
    -> durable planning snapshot + planning validation
    -> pinned six-month airport O-D demand plan
    -> exact 100/100 multi-hub assignment reproduction
    -> fresh frequency + fleet proposal within schedule-specific aircraft-minutes
    -> timetable/gate candidate exports only after hard stops pass
```

The workbook remains a source for this one-time migration and will later become an export. The canonical JSON is the authoritative schedule representation going forward.

## Run the baseline build

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m caa_scheduler baseline \
  --config config/baselines/schedule_6_v2_2_5.json
```

This writes:

- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/timetable.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/gates.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/validation_report.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/operating_validation_report.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/planning_snapshot.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/planning_validation_report.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/demand_plan.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/frequency_fleet_plan.json`
- `data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/hub_bank_plan.json`

Run the regression tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
node --test tests/*.mjs
```

## Build the web console

```bash
python -m caa_scheduler build-web --output dist
python -m http.server --directory dist 8000
```

The site loads the pinned canonical schedule and its generated reports directly. Its schedule manifest makes additional versions additive rather than requiring UI code changes. GitHub Actions publishes the console to [Golfhaus.github.io/CAA-scheduler](https://golfhaus.github.io/CAA-scheduler/).

Either consumer file can also be rebuilt directly from canonical JSON:

```bash
python -m caa_scheduler export-timetable \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json timetable.json
python -m caa_scheduler export-gates \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json gates.json
python -m caa_scheduler validate-operating \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json \
  --output operating_validation_report.json
python -m caa_scheduler reconstruct-plan \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json \
  planning_snapshot.json \
  --validation-output planning_validation_report.json \
  --demand-version bts-db1c-6mo-jul2025-apr2026-v3
python -m caa_scheduler build-demand-plan \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json \
  config/demand_data/bts_db1c_6mo_v3.json \
  demand_plan.json
python -m caa_scheduler build-frequency-plan \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/demand_plan.json \
  config/demand_data/bts_db1c_6mo_v3.json \
  frequency_fleet_plan.json
python -m caa_scheduler build-bank-plan \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/canonical_schedule.json \
  data/schedules/schedule_6_v2_2_5/frequency_fleet_plan.json \
  config/demand_data/bts_db1c_6mo_v3.json \
  hub_bank_plan.json
```

`baseline` verifies reproducibility and therefore succeeds when structural/planning validation, demand-plan parity, and both golden exports match. `validate-operating` is the enforcement command: it exits nonzero while unoverridden hard findings remain.

## Compile a candidate schedule

Export an approved configuration from **Schedule Setup**, add it to a working branch, and run:

```bash
python -m caa_scheduler build-candidate path/to/build_config.json
```

For a previous-schedule start, the compiler resolves the pinned canonical baseline from `data/schedules/<scheduleId>/canonical_schedule.json`. It writes an isolated package under `builds/<buildId>/` containing a copy of the approved input, build report, structural/operating/planning validation reports, demand plan, fresh frequency/fleet proposal, generated hub-bank plan, canonical candidate, timetable, and gate data. The manually dispatched **Build candidate schedule** GitHub Action runs the same command and retains the package as an artifact for 30 days.

If Python preflight fails, blank-start planning is requested, or an airport addition lacks the future planning stage, no candidate is emitted. If any non-waivable hard-stop check fails—including curfew enforcement—the diagnostic reports are written but the canonical, timetable, and gate outputs are suppressed. Other operating findings produce a review-required candidate rather than being silently waived.

## Current boundary

Milestone 0.7 now has a deterministic planning and demand boundary. Python reconstructs the historical plan, processes the complete pinned 105-city demand data, reproduces all 100 non-hub assignments, generates a fresh frequency/fleet proposal, defines all 24 hub banks, and places all 1,190 proposed hub-touching legs. The allocator applies square-root-damped demand shares, tier service minimums, the six-round-trip market ceiling, the 10% point-to-point ceiling, and aircraft-minute capacity. Aircraft quantities still come only from each schedule's build configuration; fleet performance and bank-search behavior live in versioned policy. Curfews remain non-waivable hard stops, and this plan records zero violations. The Planning tab exposes the proposed fleet, market, and bank work alongside historical comparisons. See [Planning engine](docs/planning_engine.md), [Candidate compiler](docs/candidate_engine.md), [Web console](docs/web_console.md), and the planning schemas under `schemas/`.

This remains a seed-and-validate compiler, not yet the full demand-to-routing optimizer. The frequency/fleet and bank files are reviewable proposals; they do not alter the frozen canonical schedule until aircraft routing can materialize continuous lines, days, routes, turns, and RONs. Entirely new point-to-point market selection, blank starts, airport additions, route construction, and automated repair remain blocked. The v2.2.5 golden schedule is intentionally **not** declared operating-rule clean. Exact historical preservation and current-policy compliance remain separate questions.

## Repository visibility

GitHub Free supports private repositories, but GitHub Pages requires a public repository on that plan. This repository is therefore intended to be public. Credentials, access tokens, and private operating data must never be committed. If future inputs need to remain private, the architecture should split them into a private engine/data repository and publish only sanitized web assets to the public Pages repository.
